## Why JobOps?

* **Universal Scraping**: Supports **LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor** + specialized boards (Gradcracker, UK Visa Jobs).
* **AI Scoring**: Ranks jobs by fit against *your* profile using your preferred LLM (OpenRouter/OpenAI/Gemini).
* **Auto-Tailoring**: Generates custom resumes (PDFs) for every application using RxResume v4.
* **Email Tracking**: Connect Gmail to auto-detect interviews, offers, and rejections.
* **Self-Hosted**: Your data stays with you. SQLite database. No SaaS fees.

## Workflow

1. **Search**: Scrapes job boards for roles matching your criteria.
2. **Score**: AI ranks jobs (0-100) based on your resume/profile.
3. **Tailor**: Generates a custom resume summary & keyword optimization for top matches.
4. **Export**: Uses [RxResume v4](https://v4.rxresu.me) to create tailored PDFs.
5. **Track**: "Smart Router" AI watches your inbox for recruiter replies.
